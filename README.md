This is a thing to improve the interface of keldon.net/hanabi, a really good website to play the game "hanabi" on.

Features: You can mouse over cards in the discard to see what was known about them when they were discarded. When it's your turn and you have no clues, there's a big black box behind the text that says so, which should make it more eye-catching.

Installation:, get the tampermonkey extension for chrome, then go to the releases page and download the latest version of the script, and install it using tampermonkey. I haven't tested any other browsers yet; it might work in greasemonkey for firefox.
