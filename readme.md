This is a Chrome extension to improve the interface of keldon.net/hanabi, a really good website to play the game "hanabi" on. There is not yet a version of this for any other browser.

Features:
 * Fixes the slowdown when you rewind inside a replay.
 * Adds slot information to play and discard messages. For example: "Hyphen_ated plays Purple 1 from slot #2".
 * You can mouse over cards on the table or in the discard to see what was known about them when they were played or discarded.
 * Add a big black box to the "No clues" notifier, to make it more eye-catching. (people often don't notice it's their turn without the clue UI showing up)

You can turn features off in the extension options page if you don't want them.

Installation: [get it from the chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/make-hanabi-great-again/pjncmjjlphlcfkkkceidbepggnjnnkjj?hl=en-US&gl=US&authuser=1)
