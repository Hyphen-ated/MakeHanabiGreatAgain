This is a Chrome extension to improve the interface of keldon.net/hanabi, a really good website to play the game "hanabi" on. There is not yet a version of this for any other browser.

Features:
 * Fixes the slowdown when you rewind inside a replay.
 * You can mouse over cards on the table or in the discard to see what was known about them when they were played or discarded.
 * Add a big black box to the "No clues" notifier, to make it more eye-catching. (people often don't notice it's their turn without the clue UI showing up)

Installation: [go to the releases page and download the latest version of this extension, which is a crx file](https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/MakeHanabiGreatAgain/releases), then drag that file onto the extensions page in Chrome.
